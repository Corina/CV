I am a full-stack junior web developer passionate about learning new technologies and applying best coding practices to build useful and fun to use apps.

In a previous life as a Project Manager in Market Research (coordinating several international teams, both technical and non-technical), I realized that working with the software development team was the most interesting and fun part of the job. I loved to see how they took an idea and transformed it into an working product. I decided this is what I want to do next in my career, so I joined Makers Academy.

I am looking for a role that requires someone inquisitive and eager to learn, where I can also use the set of skills acquired as a Project Manager.


### <a name="skills">Skills</a>
- **Technologies**: In my time at Makers Academy I learned how to work with Ruby, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Canvas.

- **Fast learner**: It took me less than a week to learn the basics of JavaScript at Makers. By the end of the week I was able to independently create the [News Summary App][2], written in Vanilla JavaScript and incorporating communication with 2 APIs, The Guardian API and Aylien API.


- **Efficient communication**: I can efficiently communicate with teams from various backgrounds by adjusting the volume of information and jargon to that team's needs. As a Project Manager at acturus I interacted with multiple international vendors, client service teams, sales teams, internal and external engineering teams as well as upper management.

- **Perform well under pressure**: In my old role my workload increased by 30% due to redundancies. I first made sure to manage expectations for all involved in the project and next I spend time streamlining and making old processes more efficient. For example by improving the way I sent daily specifications to panel vendors I gained almost 1 hour a day.

- **Good collaborator**: Communication and a positive attitude are important when working in a team and I try to be a driving force for both.

- **Dual perspective**: From my previous role I know the importance of maintaining a budget and a timeline but now I can also estimate the complexity of the technical challenges.

### <a name="makers">Makers Academy (June to August 2017)</a>
The Makers way:

- **Learn to learn** is the motto of the Makers experience and I learned to  learn autonomously and progress independently.
- **Pair programming** is a key part of Makers Academy experience and I learned to love it.
- **Learning to collaborate** is as important as learning to code. As part of the agile training we learned to deliver to tight deadlines, resolve conflicts, and efficiently communicate with each other.
- The focus on **software craftsmanship**, **TDD**, **OOD**, **MVC** and **SOLID** helped engrain best coding practices into me.
