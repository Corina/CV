London based full-stack junior web developer, passionate about learning new technologies, best coding practices and building useful and fun apps.

In a previous life as a Project Manager in Market Research (coordinating several international teams, both technical and non-technical), I realized that working with the software development team was the most interesting and fun part of the job. I loved to see how they took an idea and transformed it into an working product. I decided this is what I want to do next in my career, so I joined Makers Academy.

I'm looking for a role that requires someone inquisitive and eager to learn, where I can also leverage the set of skills acquired as a Project Manager.


### <a name="skills">Skills</a>
- **Technologies**: In my time at Makers Academy I learned how to work with Ruby, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Canvas.

- **Fast learner**: It took me less than a week to learn the basics of JavaScript at Makers. By the end of the week I was able to independently create the [News Summary App][2], written in vanilla JavaScript and incorporating communication with 2 APIs, The Guardian API and Aylien API.

- **Efficient communication**: As a Project Manager at acturus I interacted with multiple international vendors, client service teams, sales teams, internal and external engineering teams as well as upper management, so I can communicate efficiently with teams from various backgrounds. 

- **Perform well under pressure**: when workload increased by 30% due to layoffs in my previous company, I adapted to manage expectations for all involved in the project and I spent time streamlining and making old processes more efficient. For example, by improving the way I sent daily specifications to panel vendors I gained almost 1 hour / day.

- **Good collaborator**: I know that communication and a positive attitude are critical when working in a team and I try to be a driving force for both.

- **Dual perspective**: From my previous role I know the importance of maintaining a budget and a timeline but now I can also estimate the complexity of the technical challenges.

### <a name="makers">Makers Academy (June to August 2017)</a>
The Makers way:

- **Learn to learn** is the motto of the Makers experience and I learned to learn autonomously and progress independently.
- **Pair programming** is a key part of Makers Academy experience. By pair programming I improved my communication skills regarding code and I have a better appreciation of someone else's ideas and knowledge.
- **Learning to collaborate** is as important as learning to code. As part of the agile training we learned to deliver to tight deadlines, resolve conflicts, and efficiently communicate with each other.
- The focus on **TDD**, **OOD** and **MVC** helped engrain best coding practices into me.

**actûrus** (July 2013 to July 2016)
*Senior Project Manager*

My focus was ensuring the smooth running of a multi-country study, at one point representing 30% of the company's revenue.
My role was to make sure teams from across the world and from different industries worked perfectly together to deliver the data we collected on time and as specified. I was in charge of developing the project plan and determine the resources (time, money, equipment, etc.) required to deliver. 

I was regularly responsible for managing expectations and risk, operating as first point of contact for project related troubleshooting and was also in charge of quality assurance - I did the final checks on the online surveys. My attention to detail payed off several times, but one case in particular I'm most proud of: in a Japanese survey, one question didn't seem right. I don't speak Japanese and the survey was matching the specification, but it felt different from the other surveys I've done in Japanese. After running the text through Google Translate I realized that the spec had an error: two answer options were the same, one of them slightly rephrased. This error could have meant re-doing part of the work, added cost and delayed delivery.

I often took on tasks outside my role, from participating in proposal writing to helping with quality assurance process while setting up a new reporting platform.
