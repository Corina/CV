## Mihaela Corina Gheorghe

A former Project Manager in Market Research, currently learning how to code at Makers Academy. During 8 years as Project Manager I coordinated teams from technical and non-technical background and working with the development teams was always the most fun part of the job. So I decided to learn coding and switch to a more creative and challenging job: I want to make "stuff".
